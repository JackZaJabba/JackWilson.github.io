									<h2><a href="#">And this is a<br />
									massive headline</a></h2>
									<p>I am ambitious and keen to pursue a challenging career within the technology industry. I enjoy problem solving and working on projects within teams as well as alone. With the opportunity to develop new skills, I see my self-pursing a valuable career in a meaningful role. A strong work ethic developed through several part time jobs and extra curriculum activities as well as an eager willingness to take on extra courses/qualifications outside of work as of required of me.

										Education
										2017-2021 University of Reading 
										BSc Biological Sciences degree with foundation 
										A multifaceted course with a focus on Endocrinology, Human development, Cells and immunity, Skills in Biomedicine, Molecular genetics, Bioinformatics, Neurology, Venoms and poisons, Marine biology and conservation as chosen modules. Covering skills such as mathematics, lab work, essay writing, scientific processes and research, group work, presentations as well as many IT skills such as competency in Microsoft, Minitab (statistics program), Gene data banks and as well as developed the ability to read published scientific journals online. A degree in Biology definitely offers a wide range of transferable skills that I am certain I will use in the future. 
										
										2018-2021- University of Reading
										Completed three years of Spanish language, delivered as a 20-credit module each year. After always being interested in different cultures and countries, I decided to begin to learn Spanish. Learning another language opens many more opportunities in our ever more globalised world. Once I have fluency, I also aim to learn a third language. 
										
										2015-2017 Brighton and Hove Sixth form college (Bhasvic)
										-A levels in Archaeology, Geography, Biology and an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), which was an extensive research task with a focus on vaccinations, epidemics and their role in public health. 
										
										2011-2015 Warden Park Academy 
										-GCSEs in English literature and language, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Philosophy and Ethics, French, Geography, and School’s history project (Medicine through time and American western history).
										
										Work Experience
										2018-2021 Part time work as a porter in a hospital
										-Responsible for moving and setting up medical equipment, as well as transporting patients around the hospital. Improving skills such as communication with people of all ages and staying focussed on sometimes stressful situations. This also gave me a greater understanding of how co-operations function and the necessity of each department contributing to the same overall aim. 
										
										2016- Recreational assistant and trained lifeguard at local leisure centre
										-Involved large responsibility for up to 50 people at a time. Developing an understanding to predict people's behaviour and react quickly to any issue poolside in order to put people's safety first. Also gained first aid dry-side and wet-side qualifications.
										 
										2016- Retail assistant at Sainsbury’s as checkout member
										-Developed friendly confident and relaxed interpersonal skills when interacting with members of the public. Further grasped the importance of staying positive and the people around you in a word environment.
										 
										2014-2016 (Summers only) Leaflet distributor for a local restaurant 
										-Involved around 6 hours a week of work, where I would distribute 500 leaflets door by door over two days from which I learned an appreciation for the value of money and time.
										 
										
										
										
										2014- Volunteering at the British heart foundation 
										-12 hours total, I gained valuable work experience by working as a team member as well as how to work with people of all ages. My experience involved working with staff members to sort shop items, by placing them out in the correct location in the store. 
										
										2014- Work experience at East Surrey NHS Hospital 
										-Gaining an overview of the following departments: Hospital administration (filing and booking), Cardiac Imaging, the role of pharmacy in the hospital, role of a porter and various visits to different wards through one week. Lab and Pharmacy were of particular interest because of its importance within the hospital. One reflection of this experience was the recognition of the importance of each staffing member at each level in a large organisation, which provided me with the understanding of the value of each job and its contributions to the wider goals and ambitions of the entire organisation.
										
										Additional experiences
										2020-2021- University of Reading employability certificate (RED-award)
										-Currently completing the RED-award, which is a set of extra circular activities such as volunteering, work experience and attending extra lectures on career pathways and general life skills. Volunteering at a local Garden taught me that work is not just about money, but rather is about the value is brings to the community.   
										
										Late 2020-early 2021 Biology Society committee member at the University of Reading
										- Undertaking the role of a committee member, I worked as part of a team to organisation social events to provide for the society group. Strengthening organisational skills whilst managing study at University, this role encouraged confidence and creativity when organising events. 
										
										2019-2020- Thrive mentoring scheme at the University of Reading
										Involving fortnightly meetings with a mentor from outside of the university over several months. With a focus on career aspirations, CV support as well as potential job opportunities. Developing a relationship with my mentor he guided me into approaching and selecting job opportunities after university.
										
										2017- (1 week) Homestay in Spain (Valencia)
										-Completed a week in Valencia as part of a short language course. This developed my independence and confidence for how I should conduct myself in an unknown or unfamiliar environment, as I did not know anyone prior to the experience, nor had I travelled on my own before. 
										
										2017- (1 month) World challenge expedition in Sri Lanka
										-Provided charity work for a deaf and blind school, including buying new classroom equipment, performing a show in front of the school as well as completing some manual labour for the school such as gardening, digging as well as bin and rubbish management. This experience relieved the tremendous opportunities we have in our country, and therefore the importance of working hard with a grateful attitude. Taking part in team building experiences such as planning trips and activities also taught me the responsibilities of a working as a leader as well as understanding my possession when being led.
										
										2015- Completed Bronze Duke of Edinburgh (DofE) (2 days) and currently finishing Gold DofE, (5 days)
										-A DofE expedition involves choosing a destination, planning a trip up to multiple days with no phones, access to internet and adult supervision. The skills a gained from this was resilience in stressful situations as well as the ability to problem solve with little information available.  
										
										Interests and activities
										-As a keen, runner and cyclist, I was a part of my university athletics club, (10k, 5k, as well as track), I am also a regular gym attender as I believe that exercise is vitally important for health as well as for developing further discipline, which interests me greatly.
										-Language skills: a basic level of Spanish reading, writing and speaking.
										-Currently completely a brought online course in python in provided by Udemy.
										-Full UK driving licence and owner of car
